# LLUPS — Lithium Li-ion Universal Power Supply

> **Status: Draft / Untested** — Schematic and layout are procedurally generated and have not been fabricated or validated on hardware. Review all design choices and run DRC before ordering boards.

## Regenerating

The entire project (schematic, PCB, traces) is procedurally generated:

```bash
python3 generate_project.py
```

Requires KiCad 9 CLI tools (`kicad-cli`) for netlist export.

## Scoring Framework

A test suite scores PCB layout quality across 8 categories:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/kicad-helper/scripts/score_layout.py LLUPS.kicad_pcb
```

Results are saved as timestamped JSON in `scripts/results/` for regression tracking.

Compare runs:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/kicad-helper/scripts/score_layout.py LLUPS.kicad_pcb \
  --compare .claude/skills/kicad-helper/scripts/results/score_PREV.json
```

### Scoring Math

#### Static scorer (`score_layout.py`) — 0–100 scale

The **overall score** is a weighted average of 6 scored checks (2 are advisory, weight=0):

```
overall = Σ(score_i × weight_i) / Σ(weight_i)
```

| Check | Weight | Formula |
|---|---|---|
| **Trace Width Compliance** | 0.10 | `100 - 15×power_violations - 5×signal_violations` |
| **DRC Violations** | 0.35 | Logarithmic per-category (see below) |
| **Net Connectivity** | 0.15 | `100 - 10×single_pad_nets - 5×unassigned_pads` |
| **Component Placement** | 0.20 | `overlap(40) + bounds(20) + utilization(40)` |
| **Via Analysis** | 0.10 | `thermal(40) + density(30) + presence(30)` |
| **Routing Efficiency** | 0.10 | `efficiency(40) + orphan(30) + segments(30)` |
| Board Compactness | 0 (advisory) | `bbox_score(50) + grid_score(50)` |
| Footprint Orientation | 0 (advisory) | `100 × passed / checked` |

**DRC scoring** (35% of total) uses logarithmic decay so any improvement always registers:

```
issue_score(count, weight) = weight × (1 - log10(1+count) / log10(100))
```

Applied as: shorts→40pts, unconnected→30pts, crossings→15pts, clearance→10pts, cosmetic→5pts.
At 1 short: shorts contribution = 40×(1−0/2) = 40×0.5 = 20. At 10 shorts: ≈40×0.25 = 10.

**Placement scoring** (20%):
- Overlaps: 40pts (binary — any overlap = 0)
- Out-of-bounds centers: 20pts (binary)
- Utilization: 40pts, peaks at 30–70% footprint area / board area

**Via scoring** (10%):
- Thermal vias near U2/U4 within 3mm: 40pts (linear to min_thermal=4)
- Via density 2–20 /cm²: 30pts (linear outside range)
- Any vias present: 30pts (binary)

**Routing efficiency** (10%):
- Avg actual/MST ratio ≤1.5: 40pts; ≤3.0: linear; >3.0: 0pts
- Orphaned trace segments: 30 - 10×orphaned
- Has traces at all: 30pts

#### Experiment optimizer (`autoexperiment.py`) — single objective

The optimizer uses `ExperimentScore.compute()` which combines placement + routing into one scalar:

```
raw = 0.20×placement + 0.50×route_completion + 0.20×trace_efficiency + 0.10×via_score
final = raw × (board_containment / 100)          # hard penalty for out-of-board pads
```

Where:
- `placement` = `PlacementScore.total` (weighted sum of sub-scores, 0–100)
- `route_completion` = `(total_nets - failed_nets) / total_nets × 100`
- `trace_efficiency` = `max(0, min(100, 100 - avg_mm_per_routed_net))`
- `via_score` = `max(0, min(100, 100 - vias_per_routed_net × 20))`

If **shorts > 0**, an additional log-scale penalty is applied after DRC:

```
penalty = 0.10 / (1 + log10(1 + shorts))
final = final × penalty
```

1 short → ×0.05, 10 shorts → ×0.033, 100 shorts → ×0.025. Scores stay positive so the optimizer can still distinguish "fewer shorts is better" even when all candidates are failing.

**PlacementScore sub-weights** (applied inside `compute_total()`):

| Sub-score | Weight | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| net_distance | 0.20 | connected components are close |
| crossover_score | 0.20 | fewer ratsnest crossings |
| compactness | 0.02 | board area utilization |
| edge_compliance | 0.08 | connectors/holes near edges |
| rotation_score | 0.05 | pad alignment quality |
| board_containment | 0.25 | fraction of pads inside outline |
| courtyard_overlap | 0.20 | no courtyard collisions |

## Autonomous Experiment Loop

Run layout optimization offline — no AI tokens, just CPU time:

```bash
cd .claude/skills/kicad-helper/scripts

# Run 50 rounds of placement+routing experiments
python3 autoexperiment.py ../../../../LLUPS.kicad_pcb --rounds 50

# Run overnight with longer plateau tolerance
python3 autoexperiment.py ../../../../LLUPS.kicad_pcb --rounds 500 --plateau 8

# Custom output and verbose logging
python3 autoexperiment.py ../../../../LLUPS.kicad_pcb -n 100 -o best.kicad_pcb -v
```

Edit `program.md` to steer the search space (parameter ranges, scoring weights).
Results log to `.experiments/experiments.jsonl`. Plot results:

```bash
python3 plot_experiments.py ../../../../.experiments/experiments.jsonl
```
